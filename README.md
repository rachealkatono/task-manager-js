# Overview

The goal of this project is to strengthen my skills as a software engineer by building practical JavaScript applications. 

This software is a responsive **Task Manager** web application that demonstrates fundamental JavaScript features such as variables, functions, classes, arrays, conditionals, loops, recursion, and ES6+ syntax. Users can create, edit, delete, and organize tasks and subtasks, with data persistence using browser local storage.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript syntax, DOM manipulation, and simple application structure. The 4–5 minute demo video provides a walkthrough of the code and highlights what I learned about JavaScript language features.
